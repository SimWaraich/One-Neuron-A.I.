# One-Neuron-A.I.

This was meant for a computer science club I teach to high school students.

The point of it was to introduce them to the world of AI without adding in complications that would otherwise discourage them.

I made it a point to comment and include many video tutorials explaining in concept in layman terms on my google classroom link(message me if you want to join!).
